    Allows the encryption of .txt and .csv files through the "Caesar Cipher" algorithm by using functional
    programming and recursion. For now we are focusing to accomplish this program to run with this
    algorithm; for future references we would like to modify the algorithm to be less predictable.

    The Elixir program reads the text file and assigns a line to a list as a string to be converted,
    all this lists will be stored on another list. The lists will be assigned to an individual
    thread in order to concurrently convert the whole text file.
